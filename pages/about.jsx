                        My name is Madison! I'm a front end web developer who
                        specializes in making web accessible and user friendly
                        content! I'm an unapologetic emoji user ðŸ’¯ and I'm here
                        to share my learning process. This site is just a
                        collection of different blog posts and projects that I'm
                        working on at any given moment. If you really want to
                        learn more about me, hopefully I'll be putting some more
                        content below for you to do so.
